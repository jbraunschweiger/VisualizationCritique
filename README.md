# Studio 1
Jakob Braunschweiger - 466081

Team Members: The random breakout room I was placed in was empty, so I worked on my own this week.
External Resources: I used the bootstrap documentation at getbootstrap.com
Optional Assignment: I did the optional assignment. It is possible that as I switched over to Bootstrap css, some of the custom CSS that the studio became obsolete. If there are any issues feel free to reach out to me and I can submit the commit from before I attempted the optional challenge.
